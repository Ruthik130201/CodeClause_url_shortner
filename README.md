==> Pyperclip is a cross-platform Python module for copy and paste clipboard functions. It works with both Python 2 and 3. This module was created to enable cross-platform copy-pasting in Python which was earlier absent. The pyperclip module has copy() and paste() functions that can send text to and receive text from your computerâ€™s clipboard. Sending the output of your program to the clipboard will make it easy to paste it on an email, word processor, or some other software.
eg : # importing the library
import pyperclip as pc

number = 100

# copying text to clipboard
pc.copy(number)

# pasting the text from clipboard
text = pc.paste()

print(text)
print(type(text))

output: 100

==>from tkinter import *
In order to work with a tkinter application, we have to install and import the tkinter library in our environment. Generally, we import the tkinter library in the environment by using from tkinter import * command.
The significance of "import *" represents all the functions and built-in modules in the tkinter library. By importing all the functions and methods, we can use the inbuilt functions or methods in a particular application without importing them implicitly.
eg: In this particular example, we create a functional application that will contain a button and a label widget.

from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
win= Tk()
win.geometry("750x250")
def change_text():
   label.configure(text="Welcome")
label=Label(win, text= "Click the below button to Change this Text", font=('Aerial 20 bold'))
label.pack(pady=30)
button= ttk.Button(win, text="Commit",command=lambda:change_text())
button.pack()
win.mainloop()

output: Executing the above code will display a window that contains a button and a text label showing some text. When we click the button, it will change the message on the screen.
